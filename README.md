### 42 Project about finding risks and vulnerabilities while auditing a website.

This specific website shows breaches, some of which still show on well established websites you visit on a daily basis.

***Each vulnerability will be documented as follows:***
- Flag
- Vulnerability text file with description about the vulnerability and how to avoid those breaches
- Bash file which, when executed, shows the behavior of this vulnerability
