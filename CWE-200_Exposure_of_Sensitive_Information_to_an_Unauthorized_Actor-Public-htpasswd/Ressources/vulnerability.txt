HOW WE FOUND IT
After finding the robots.txt file, we checked the folder "whatever" that it indicated as disallowed (for crawling bots)
The file htpasswd is listed in the directory

htpasswd is a sensitive file containing usernames and passwords for the server, it is not supposed to be publicly accessible

the file is here publicly reachable: http://darkly/whatever/htpasswd
the htpasswd file contains "root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3", looks like a login:password couple !

We got the hash 8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3 = dragon in the htpasswd file (http://darkly/whatever/htpasswd)
We try to login in the normal signin page without success

We look for other pages for signin in, not find any...

we try to find hidden pages not referenced on the website...

The /admin page (quite classic for a website) exists !

We put the credentials into the admin page http://darkly/admin with success.
login : root
password : dragon 

SUCCESS, we got the flaaag

PROBLEM
The critical file htpasswd is publicly accessible, and contains a weak password that lets us authenticate as admin 

SOLUTION
- Restrict access to critical files at the server configuration level (should return 403 Forbidden)
- Make the admin login page less guessable
- Start using strong passwords !
