HOW WE FOUND IT:
We checked which kind of cookies are used and realized our cookie "I_am_admin" had the value "68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327" = "false" (MD5). We tried to set the value of the cookie equal to "true" = "b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09" and we received a popup with the flag.

PROBLEM:
The website doesn't verify if a cookie is valid for the current user. Attackers could bypass protection mechanisms like authorization and authentication by modifying the cookie to an expected value.

SOLUTION:
Do not use boolean cookie data for security decisions (giving admin access in our case).
Implement stronger security-checks for cookie content (do not trust user controlled data). 
Otherwise implement backend checks to verify that the user can have admin access.
