HOW WE FOUND IT:
We found a hidden page link in the footer (href="?page=e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c") and opened the page.
We inspect this new page and find two comments: "Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot." and "You must cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step".
We knew that the browser is referred to in the User-Agent http header and we knew that the Referer http header is used to indicate from which page the client comes from.
We changed the Referer to "https://www.nsa.gov/" and the User-Agent to ft_bornToSec and resent the request. TADAAA the flag appears.

PROBLEM:
Website doesn't restrict resources if you put specific parameters.
The inputs are not controlled by the server so it is possible for anyone to bypass the prtotection mechanism and  access hidden resources.

SOLUTION:
Don't trust http headers, they can be modified just as normal user input
