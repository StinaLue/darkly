HOW WE FOUND IT:
When inspecting the code of the votes, we tried simply changing the possible values of the voting (usually voting from 1 to 10 -> modified the number 10 to 100000). When we then voted with 100000, the website seemed to accept it as input and the flag appeared.

PROBLEM :
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable. This can lead to modification of critical data. The validation of input is improperly handled. The input could even be modified to be malicious.

HOW TO SOLVE IT:
The input should strictly be validated. In our case: If the input is not a digit between 1 and 10, ignore the input (and optionally send an error message).
