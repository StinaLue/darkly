HOW WE FOUND IT:
We inspected the page http://darkly/index.php?page=recover and realized that there is a hidden field with the value "webmaster@borntosec.com" to recover the password. We modified this value and click on submit. The website doesn't detect the modification and we get the flag.

THE PROBLEM:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable. This can lead to modification of critical data. The validation of input is improperly handled. The input could even be modified to be malicious.
An attacker could here modify the mail for password recovery to intercept the secret mail.

HOW TO SOLVE IT:
The mail input should be an immutable parameter, and if needed to be processes by the server, the input should strictly be validated. If the mail input gets modified, ignore the input (and optionally send an error message). Otherwise find a way to make the request backend so that it can't even be modified in the first place.
