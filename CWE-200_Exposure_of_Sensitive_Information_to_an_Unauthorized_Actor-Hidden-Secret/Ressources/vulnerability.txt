We used the robots.txt file to identify restricted or private areas.
We found two files: .hidden and whatever (both disallowed).

While navigating through the .hidden directory, we realized that there are for each directory two subdirectories. Each directory has a README file. We suspect the goal is to find the README file with a flag.

With "wget" we downloaded all directories of darkly/.hidden.
We listed all the README files (by bypassing the disallowed tag - robots=off) and identified that most of the README files have the same values. We then removed all the duplicates and the output showed us some normal entries like "Demande à ton voisin de droite" or "Demande à ton voisin de gauche" as well as the flag (length of 34 ......).
