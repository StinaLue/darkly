HOW WE FOUND IT:
Identified page parameter in commom GET request, tried common path-traversal attacks.



PROBLEM:

Website is vulnerable to path-traversal attacks.
Any file present on the server can be read by anyone including critical files.



SOLUTION:

If possible, don't use user input when using filesystem calls

Probably easiest solution: associate each authorized filename to a number.
Other way to solve that: Whitelisting authorized files and blacklisting inputs of path traversal (../../, .., %2e%2e%2f, etc.).
